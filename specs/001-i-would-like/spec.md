# Feature Specification: Podcast Landing Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I would like to create the landing page for the static site. It should be a welcoming experience that points users to various content. The website is a podcast website so episodes should be heavily highlighted. Additional site content is about, sponsors, contact us, guests, and social links (discord, twitter, etc)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: The hero section should introduce the podcast, but what specific content should it contain? ‚Üí A: Podcast title, tagline, featured latest episode player, and call-to-action
- Q: What should the call-to-action button in the hero section do? ‚Üí A: Join the Discord
- Q: Should About, Sponsors, Contact Us, Guests be separate pages or sections within the landing page? ‚Üí A: Separate pages or collections within content folder

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A podcast listener visits the website for the first time and needs to quickly understand what the podcast is about, discover recent episodes, and find ways to engage with the community. The landing page serves as the central hub that welcomes visitors and guides them to the content and features they're looking for.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor arrives at the landing page, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a welcoming introduction to the podcast with recent episodes prominently displayed
2. **Given** a visitor wants to explore podcast content, **When** they scroll through the landing page, **Then** they can easily access featured episodes with title, publication date, duration, brief description (2-3 sentences), and thumbnail/cover art
3. **Given** a visitor wants to learn more about the podcast, **When** they navigate the landing page, **Then** they can find links to About, Sponsors, Contact Us, and Guests sections
4. **Given** a visitor wants to join the community, **When** they look for social connections, **Then** they can find links to Discord, Twitter, YouTube, and RSS feed
5. **Given** a returning visitor arrives at the landing page, **When** they view the page, **Then** they can quickly see if new episodes have been published since their last visit

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no published episodes yet?
- How does the page handle very long episode titles or descriptions?
- What happens if social media links are not yet configured?
- How should the page display if sponsor information is unavailable?
