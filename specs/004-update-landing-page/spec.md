## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: The Episodes navigation link needs to appear "in the title bar alongside" other links. What should be the exact position of the Episodes link in the navigation? ‚Üí A: First position (leftmost on desktop) - Episodes as primary content
- Q: The specification mentions episodes should display with "brief description" but doesn't define length limits. What is the maximum length for episode descriptions displayed in the Recent Episodes cards? ‚Üí A: 1 sentence (approximately 80-100 characters) - Minimal teaser

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visitor navigates the podcast website and needs to easily access episode content from any page. The navigation should include an Episodes link that allows quick access to the episode archive. Additionally, when viewing the landing page, the Recent Episodes section should correctly display the latest podcast episodes to help visitors discover new content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor is on the landing page, **When** they view the navigation bar, **Then** they see an "Episodes" link in the first position (leftmost on desktop) in the title bar, followed byfollowed by About, Sponsors, Contact, and Guests
2. **Given** a visitor clicks the Episodes link in the navigation, **When** the link is activated, **Then** they are taken to the episodes archive page showing all published episodes
3. **Given** the landing page loads, **When** the Recent Episodes section renders, **Then** it displays up to 5 latest episodes with title, date, thumbnail, brief description (1 sentence, 80-100 characters), and duration
4. **Given** there are published episodes in the system, **When** a visitor views the Recent Episodes section, **Then** the episodes are sorted from newest to oldest by publication date
5. **Given** a visitor is viewing the Recent Episodes section, **When** they click on an episode card, **Then** they are taken to that specific episode's page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no published episodes to display in Recent Episodes?
- What happens when there are fewer than 5 episodes available?
- How does the Episodes navigation link behave on mobile devices in the hamburger menu?
