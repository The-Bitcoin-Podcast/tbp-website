## Episode Description

This is a weekly headline show where Dee and Jessie Broke do their best to highlight bits of nonce-sense from Crypto News. We only choose three articles, essentially at random, from the litany of blockchain news that is syndicated throughout a week. If you are interested in all the news articles that we horde in a week, please visit the link below to look at our collection.  
  
 Topics: -Basis coin, a new stable coin, crumbles. -Finland narcs on their traders...taxes gonna get paid. -ASICs aren't all winners... -Jessie is not the best Battlerite player in all of North America
