## Episode Description

The winter is real. Low hanging fruit is we talk about the price and what that means for the community, but more importantly we evaluate what it means for developers and the interest as a whole. In addition, Vinny Lingham the OG internet entrepreneur who is the co-founder &amp; CEO of Civic - an identity protection and management startup - joins us in the studio. He was also previously the founder and CEO of Gyft &amp; Yola, Inc. and of course we chat about his bearish attitude on ETH, the correct way to do an ICO, and more!
