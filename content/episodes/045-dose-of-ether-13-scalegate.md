## Episode Description

We are back with our regular format where this week Bijan and Lucian talk about scaling Ethereum and the different directions that can be taken. We cover if sharding is necessary, and how close we are to some promising ideas like using STARKS or Random Beacons. Lastly, we debate if the Ethereum Foundation should change due to the massive increase in the size of the community.
