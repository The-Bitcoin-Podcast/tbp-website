## Episode Description

In Episode 15 of The Bull Pen Podcast, The Crypto Bully takes some time to speak with all his listeners directly. It’s been a busy and somewhat chaotic past few weeks for both Lyndon and the crypto markets so he wanted to discuss topics like market sentiment, ways he plans on taking advantage of the current bear market and his big plans for the podcast going into 2019.
