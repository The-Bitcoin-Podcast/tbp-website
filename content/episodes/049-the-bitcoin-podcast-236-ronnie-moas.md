## Episode Description

Ronnie Moas, the founder of Standpoint Research, a top-ranking stock and crypto picker, comes on our show to talk about the $DIG fiasco that has been frustrating him lately and wants to set the record straight. However, unlike the other guys \(we ain't naming names!\), you know we give people a platform to speak but we also know a lot of concerned followers of his have questions that need answered. Ronnie Moas admits here that he did no due diligence, did not analyze anything about Arbitrade or DIG. We are not accusing Ronnie Moas of being corrupt, but at the very least was he reckless? We try to get to the bottom of it as we invite Ray Redacted onto the show to spitball commentary with us as well as speak with Ronnie himself. The token, Dignity \(DIG\), will have a one-dollar USD of gold bullion reserved against each token. Details about the company, the tokens, the bullion reserves, and the Board are all touched upon in this episode. We try our best to cover everything. Just remember folks, Past performance is not an indicator of future returns. Stay safe out there.
