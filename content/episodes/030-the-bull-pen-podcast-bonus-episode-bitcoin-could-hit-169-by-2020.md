## Episode Description

In this bonus episode of The Bull Pen Podcast, The Crypto Bully and DJsNeverEndingStory team up to chat about the possibility of Bitcoin hitting $169 dollars by 2020. DJ is the host of Crypto Until Infinity Podcast, also on The Bitcoin Podcast Network, has experience as a successful music producer and audio engineer and is the 15+ year friend responsible for getting Lyndon interested and active into blockchain and cryptocurrency. Even though many important topics were discussed including the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation of Tether and Bitfinex, Bakkt delaying its Bitcoin futures launch and the importance of educating oneself if deciding to trade crypto, expect for there to be a healthy dose of humor during their chat as well. As The Crypto Bully says, “Let’s do it!”
