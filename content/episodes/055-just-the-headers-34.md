## Episode Description

This is a weekly headline show where Dee and Jessie Broke do their best to highlight bits of nonce-sense from Crypto News. We only choose three articles, from the litany of blockchain news that is syndicated throughout a week. If you are interested in all the news articles that we horde in a week, please visit the link below to look at our collection.  
  
 This week: -Mining is a tough business. -India may un-ban cryptocurrency but ever so slightly. -GA Senator is fraudulent...allegedly. -Jessie would make for a nonchalant legislature.  
  
 Enjoy!
