## Episode Description

Special holiday episode. This time we keep things light as we have a bunch of listeners call in on the show! Mainly we discuss if Bitcoin is still cool. Is it cool baby? Sure, or else we wouldn't be here. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone. This past year has been a roller-coaster ride for many. We aren't trying to add to the FUD, it's just a good time. Hit play!
