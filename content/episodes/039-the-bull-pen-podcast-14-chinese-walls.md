## Episode Description

In Episode 14 of The Bull Pen Podcast, The Crypto Bully steps into the Bull Pen with Harish D. Gupta who has a background in financial economics and has worked for the well-known financial institutions Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Barclays. As the Co-Founder and CEO of a multi-asset global exchange platform, Harish and Lyndon go into detail on what exactly Polybird is aiming to accomplish once launched and many of its innerworkings. With its described features such as Chinese Walls, “Global issuers such as financial institutions, governments, and companies can raise capital \(equity or debt\) via issuing digital tokens or list tokenized assets \(currencies, commodities, commercial real estate\) on a global exchange.” Lyndon has also included some special audio with the very special guest John Lee Dumas so be sure to tune in until the end.
