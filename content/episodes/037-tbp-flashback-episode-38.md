## Episode Description

Welcome to our flashback series where we give you access to archived shows on our feed that are so outdated you can’t find it on our feed anymore. With crypto being so unpredictable, we thought it would be fun for our new listeners to check out episodes of our older content. It’s like opening up a time capsule! Originally aired in February 2016, Episode 38 focused on the question of “how to store your bitcoins” which leads to one of the most important decisions for a Bitcoin user to make. But like Reading Rainbow, you don’t have to take our word for it. Joining us this week is Alena Vranova, business developer, Co-founder of SatoshiLabs, and the creator of TREZOR. She chatted with us about crypto, economy, security, questions of life, everything! It’s a good listen. You know what to do.
