## Episode Description

Corey is back from Prague to give us recap part II of Devcon4. In addition, we invite "Shark Tank" participant Dmitri Love, who successfully pitched his company Bundil, a mobile app for investing in cryptocurrencies to the sharks - landing a $100K investment and a 50/50 business partnership with Kevin O'Leary, AKA "Mr. Wonderful". The concept behind the app works by automatically investing a users spare change into the cryptocurrency market. If you spent $9.50 somewhere, the app will automatically round up to the nearest dollar, investing $0.50 into your crypto portfolio in the app, which currently features Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. This is definitely an entrepreneurial focused show. Let's get to it!
