## Episode Description

As Bitcoin’s price has declined over the last year, critics have been quick to declare the virtual currency dead. Bitcoin’s true value, though, might not be in the currency itself but in the engine that makes it possible. Data security is becoming the sparkle in bitcoin. We discuss this, as well as invite the CEO and Co-Founder of Airbitz, Paul Puey, to talk about how he is making it insanely easy to send and secure this revolutionary currency and other digital assets while maintaining the highest level of privacy.  
  
“Bitcoin has given us the motivation to build good end-point edge security for people.”
