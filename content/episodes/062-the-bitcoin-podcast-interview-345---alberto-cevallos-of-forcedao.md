## Episode Description

\*\*OUR GUEST BIO\*\*  
  
Force DAO is a newly launched yield aggregator. Users deposit digital assets into smart contract vaults, and each vault executes its own strategy that puts funds to work across the DeFi ecosystem to return yield to depositors. The excitement around Force is growing, as shown by Force DAO's public beta in March, 2021 that topped over $50m in TVL within a couple hours. Force will open the caps in Early April alongside a wide governance token airdrop.  Because Force has received significant attention from major DeFi users and partner projects, lead developer and Co-founder Alberto Cevallos is coming to talk about Force, the evolution of DeFi, and how he foresees a multi-chain DeFi future.
