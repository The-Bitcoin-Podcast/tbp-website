## Episode Description

OK, we've talked about the crazy DAO project, but what about solutions? Technically, it's not illegal. The 'hacker' played fair and square by rules that were entirely legit albeit obscure and somewhat hidden in the code. Well, Peter Vessenes thinks the best one for TheDAO token holders is a straight up refund. There are lots of possibilities forward. A surprising number of people have contacted us about a whitehat attack on TheDAO. If whitehats do go ahead and attack TheDAO with the goal of saving at least 70% of the funds, avoid lawsuits and lengthy bankruptcy proceedings, again, Refund Wallet. We discuss ALL this and more.
